This repository provides the codes for the paper "Confidence regions for entries of a large precision matrix".

The file **Precision.txt** provides the functions: 

- **BTDistKernelAR1()** for testing precision coefficients being zero except the main diagonal and the first off-diagonal; 

- **BTDistKernelBlockDiag()** for testing precision coefficients being zero except *k* blocks along the main diagonal.

**AR05p100.R** and **BD05p100.R** are the R files for simualtion under the AR and block diagonal covariance structures.
