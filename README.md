This repository provides the codes for the paper "Confidence regions for entries of a large precision matrix".

The file "Precision.txt" provides the functions: 

- **BTDistKernelAR1SLcorrect()** for testing precision coefficients being zero except the main diagonal and the first off-diagonal; 

- **BTDistKernelBlockDiagSLcorrect()** for testing precision coefficients being zero except k blocks along the main diagonal.
